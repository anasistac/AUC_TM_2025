        "> Remember that this is a code notebook - add an explanation of what you do using text boxes and markdown, and comment your code. Answers without explanations may get less points.\n",
        ">\n",
        "> If you re-use a substantial portion of code you find online, e.g on Stackoverflow, you need to add a link to it and make the borrowing explicit. The same applies of you take it and modify it, even substantially. There is nothing bad in doing that, providing you are acknowledging it and make it clear you know what you're doing.\n",
        ">\n",
        "> The **Generative AI policy** from the syllabus for the programming assignments applies. Generative AI can be used as a source of information in these assignments if properly referenced. You can use generative AI assistance for writing code, but you must reference the chat used as a source, just as if you would take from StackOverflow. In ChatGPT, you can make an URL to the information you obtained by clicking the \"Share link to Chat\" button and then \"Copy Link\". This allows you to cite the source of the information you use in your answer or code solution. Of course, as you know, GenAI tools are not always a reliable source and its answers are intransparantly drawn from other sources - it is recommended to cross-check its output with other sources or your own understanding of the topic.\n",
        ">\n",
        "> For the explanations of what you do that you provide with each question, as well as for (sub)questions that ask about things like motivation of choices or your opinion, the answer to this must be conceptualized and written by yourself and not copied from a generative AI source.\n",
        ">\n",
        "> Make sure your notebooks have been run when you submit, as I won't run them myself. Submit both the `.ipynb` file along with an `.html` export of the same. Submit all necessary auxilliary files as well. Please compress your submission into a `.zip` archive. Only `.zip` files can be submitted.\n",
        "> If you are using Google Colab, here is a tutorial for obtaining an HTML export: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53460051/convert-ipynb-notebook-to-html-in-google-colab .\n",
        ">\n",
        "> With Jupyter, you can simply export it as HTML through the File menu."

        "> * 70 points for correctly completing the assignment.\n",
        ">\n",
        "> * 20 points for appropriately writing and organizing your code in terms of structure, readibility (also by humans), comments and minimal documentation. It is important to be concise but also to explain what you did and why, when not obvious. Feel free to re-use functions and variables from previous questions if that helps for structure and readability - you do not need to repeat previous steps for each question.\n",
        ">\n",
        "> * 10 points for doing something extra, e.g., if you go beyond expectations (overall or on something specific). Some ideas for extras might be mentioned in the exercises, or you can come up with your own. You don't need to do them all to get the bonus. The sum of points is 90, doing (some of) the extras can bring you to 100, so the extras are not necessary to get an A.\n",

Then I applied PPMI by setting negative values to 0 to reduce noise and focus on informative co-occurrences.\n",
        "The code loops over each target-context pair, retrieves their co-occurrence and marginal frequencies, and computes the PMI score using NLTK’s built-in function. The result is a new matrix where each value reflects how unexpectedly often two words co-occur. Observing the results of the matrix, the output makes sense since, for instance, we can see a high score of 4.6 between the words \"damage\" and \"weather\" However, we can see the value 0 when it comes to the relation between the words \"trade\" and \"weather\", meaning either they did not co-occur (most likely in my opinion), or they did not co-occur more than expected."

PLMI not only captures how strong the association between two words is but also how reliable the association is based on how often it occurs.\n",
        "To compute the PLMI I first computed the joint and marginal probabilities of each pair (word, context), used it to calculate the PPMI of each pair and multiplied the PPMI values by the corresponding co-occurrence counts to get the PLMI scores. Now the matrix reflects both the strength and frequency of the associations between words and their contexts. For instance, the words \"has\" and \"said\" with a rate of 1341.27 shows the words are very frequent and semantically related, in comparison to \"damage\" and \"weather\" which is much less frequent than others"

I first adjusted the context probabilities, used them to compute PMI and finally clipped negative values to obtain the smoothed PPMI. The matrix still captures strong associations, but in a more managed way. For instance, \"damage\" and \"weather\" remains a strong pair, while some pairs that involve very frequent words like \"said\" had very low PPMI (near 0) and now seem boosted, which might be due to the change of frequency ratios when smoothing."
